[{"content":"Updating nested array subdocuments based on a field in the main document is a common task when working with MongoDB and Mongoose. Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple guide and example to help you accomplish this.\nPlan Use Model.updateMany() or Model.findOneAndUpdate() to update multiple or a single document. Use an aggregation pipeline ([{}]) as the second argument to reference document fields. Use the $set stage within the pipeline to update the nested array. Use the $$ROOT variable to reference fields from the main document. Example Assume you have a User model where each user has an array of posts, and you want to set each post\u0026rsquo;s authorName field based on the user\u0026rsquo;s name field.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how you can do it:\nconst mongoose = require(\u0026#39;mongoose\u0026#39;); const { Schema } = mongoose; const postSchema = new Schema({ title: String, content: String, authorName: String, // This is what we want to update }); const userSchema = new Schema({ name: String, posts: [postSchema], }); const User = mongoose.model(\u0026#39;User\u0026#39;, userSchema); async function updatePostAuthorNames() { await User.updateMany( {}, // Update condition, {} means all documents [ { $set: { posts: { $map: { input: \u0026#34;$posts\u0026#34;, as: \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;, in: { $mergeObjects: [ \u0026#34;$$post\u0026#34;, { authorName: \u0026#34;$name\u0026#34; } // Set authorName in each post to the user\u0026#39;s name ] } } } } } ] ); } updatePostAuthorNames().then(() =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#39;Update complete.\u0026#39;)); Explanation Define Schemas: Define the postSchema and userSchema. Update Logic: Use updateMany() to update all user documents. Use an aggregation pipeline to modify the documents. The $set stage updates the posts array. The $map operator iterates over the posts array. The $mergeObjects operator merges the original post object ($$post) with a new object containing the updated authorName set to the user\u0026rsquo;s name. Running the Update To run the update function, simply call it:\nupdatePostAuthorNames().then(() =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#39;Update complete.\u0026#39;)); This script updates the authorName for all posts based on their respective user\u0026rsquo;s name.\nConclusion Updating nested array subdocuments using a main document field value in MongoDB with Mongoose is straightforward with the right approach. Using aggregation pipelines and Mongoose\u0026rsquo;s powerful querying capabilities, you can efficiently perform these updates.\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-update-nested-array-with-mongoose/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUpdating nested array subdocuments based on a field in the main document is a common task when working with MongoDB and Mongoose.

One powerful tool for this task is ffmpeg, a versatile command-line program for handling multimedia data. In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the process of installing ffmpeg and using it to download streaming video.\nInstalling ffmpeg Before you can use ffmpeg, you need to install it on your system. One of the simplest ways to install ffmpeg on Windows is via Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows. Follow these steps to install ffmpeg:\nInstall Chocolatey: If you haven\u0026rsquo;t installed Chocolatey yet, open a command prompt with administrative privileges and run the following command:\n@\u0026#34;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\u0026#34; -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \u0026#34;iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\u0026#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1\u0026#39;))\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; SET \u0026#34;PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin\u0026#34; Install ffmpeg: Once Chocolatey is installed, you can install ffmpeg by running the following command in the command prompt:\nchoco install ffmpeg-full This command installs the full version of ffmpeg, which includes all the libraries and codecs needed for a wide range of video and audio processing tasks.\nUsing ffmpeg to Download Streaming Video Once ffmpeg is installed, you can use it to download and save a portion of a streaming video. The basic command to achieve this is:\nffmpeg -ss [start timestamp] -i [video path or url] -t [duration] [outputname.mp4] Breaking Down the Command -ss [start timestamp]: This option specifies the starting point of the video clip you want to download. The timestamp should be in the format hh:mm:ss. For example, 00:01:30 starts the clip at 1 minute and 30 seconds.\n-i [video path or url]: This option specifies the input file or URL of the streaming video. Replace [video path or url] with the actual path or URL of the video you want to download.\n-t [duration]: This option specifies the duration of the clip you want to download, starting from the timestamp specified by -ss. The duration should be in the format hh:mm:ss. For example, 00:00:30 will download a 30-second clip.\n[outputname.mp4]: This is the name of the output file where the downloaded clip will be saved. Replace outputname.mp4 with your desired file name.\nExample Command Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to download a 1-minute clip from a video starting at 2 minutes and 30 seconds. If the URL of the video is http://example.com/video.mp4, you would use the following command:\nffmpeg -ss 00:02:30 -i http://example.com/video.mp4 -t 00:01:00 myclip.mp4 This command tells ffmpeg to start 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the video, download a clip that lasts for 1 minute, and save it as myclip.mp4.\nTips and Tricks Adjusting Quality: You can adjust the quality of the output video by adding options like -b:v for video bitrate and -b:a for audio bitrate. For example, -b:v 1000k sets the video bitrate to 1000 kbps.\nHandling Errors: If you encounter errors, make sure the video URL is accessible and that ffmpeg supports the streaming format of the video. Some streaming services use encryption or DRM that ffmpeg cannot bypass.\nFurther Learning: ffmpeg is an incredibly powerful tool with many options and features. The official ffmpeg documentation is a great resource to learn more about its capabilities.\nBy following these steps, you can easily download and save streaming video clips using ffmpeg. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re archiving important content or just want to watch videos offline, ffmpeg provides a flexible and powerful solution.\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-download-streaming-video-with-ffmpeg/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"how-to-download-streaming-video-using-ffmpeg\"\u003eHow to Download Streaming Video Using ffmpeg\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreaming video has become ubiquitous, but sometimes you might want to save a portion of a video for offline viewing or archival purposes.

In NestJS, interceptors provide a powerful way to manipulate the flow of data. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to use an interceptor to sanitize API responses by removing specific properties. We\u0026rsquo;ll also look at how to write tests to ensure the interceptor behaves as expected.\nInterceptors can be used to manipulate API responses in other ways as well. For instance, for creating pagination headers or similar purposes.\nBackground Before diving into the implementation, let\u0026rsquo;s briefly understand the purpose of the interceptor and the scenario it addresses. The ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor is designed to remove specific properties (e.g. 'my_super_secret_secret') from the API responses. These properties are often used internally by databases and might not be relevant or safe to expose to the clients consuming the API.\nImplementation The interceptor class ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor implements the NestInterceptor interface. It intercepts the response data and uses a recursive approach to remove the specified properties from objects and arrays. The interceptor is applied globally to the application using app.useGlobalInterceptors(new ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor()).\nimport { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from \u0026#39;@nestjs/common\u0026#39; import { Observable } from \u0026#39;rxjs\u0026#39; import { map } from \u0026#39;rxjs/operators\u0026#39; @Injectable() export class ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; implements NestInterceptor\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { readonly omittedProperties = [\u0026#39;my_super_secret_secret\u0026#39;] intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { return next.handle().pipe(map((data) =\u0026gt; this.sanitizeProperties(data))) } private sanitizeProperties(data: any): any { if (Array.isArray(data)) { return data.map((item) =\u0026gt; this.sanitizeProperties(item)) } if (typeof data === \u0026#39;object\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; data !== null) { const sanitizedData = {} for (const key in data) { if (!this.omittedProperties.includes(key)) { sanitizedData[key] = this.sanitizeProperties(data[key]) } } return sanitizedData } return data } } Writing Tests Writing tests is a crucial step to ensure that the interceptor behaves as expected. In this case, the test suite focuses on the TestController and verifies that the interceptor removes the specified property ('my_super_secret_secret') from the API response.\nimport { Controller, Get, HttpStatus, INestApplication } from \u0026#39;@nestjs/common\u0026#39; import { Test } from \u0026#39;@nestjs/testing\u0026#39; import { Public } from \u0026#39;nest-keycloak-connect\u0026#39; import * as request from \u0026#39;supertest\u0026#39; import { ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor } from \u0026#39;./response-payload-sanitization.interceptor\u0026#39; import { AppModule } from \u0026#39;../../app.module\u0026#39; @Public() @Controller() class TestController { // eslint-disable-next-line class-methods-use-this @Get(\u0026#39;/api/test\u0026#39;) test() { return { results: [ { my_super_secret_secret: \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;, value: \u0026#39;hey\u0026#39;, foo: { my_super_secret_secret: \u0026#39;2\u0026#39;, value: \u0026#39;hoy\u0026#39;, }, }, ], } } } describe(\u0026#39;ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { let app: INestApplication beforeEach(async () =\u0026gt; { app = ( await Test.createTestingModule({ imports: [AppModule], controllers: [TestController], }).compile() ).createNestApplication() app.useGlobalInterceptors(new ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor()) }) it(\u0026#39;should remove all secret properties from response\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { await app.init() const response = await request(app.getHttpServer()).get(\u0026#39;/api/test\u0026#39;) expect(response.status).toBe(HttpStatus.OK) expect(JSON.stringify(response.body)).toBe( JSON.stringify({ results: [ { value: \u0026#39;hey\u0026#39;, foo: { value: \u0026#39;hoy\u0026#39;, }, }, ], }) ) }) afterEach(async () =\u0026gt; { await app.close() }) }) The test case should remove all secret properties from response initializes the NestJS application, sends a request to the /api/test endpoint, and checks if the interceptor has successfully removed the specified properties from the response. The supertest library is used to make HTTP requests and assert the expected behavior.\nConclusion Using interceptors in NestJS provides a clean and reusable way to modify the behavior of your API. The ResponsePayloadSanitizationInterceptor showcased here is a practical example of how interceptors can be used to sanitize API responses by removing specific properties. Writing tests ensures that the interceptor functions correctly and provides a safety net for future changes.\nBy incorporating this interceptor into your NestJS application, you can enhance the security and cleanliness of your API responses, making them more suitable for consumption by client applications.\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-manipulate-nestjs-response/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn any API development project, ensuring that sensitive or unnecessary data is not exposed in the responses is crucial for security and efficiency.

Recently, I came accross with the default port (5000) used for local development server and the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center server. In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce a workaround that involves editing the Windows registry to resolve the conflict and ensure smooth development processes.\nUnderstanding the Issue:\nThe Intel(R) Graphics Command Center server, specifically the OneApp.IGCC.WinService.exe executable, by default, utilizes port 5000. However, this port is commonly used for development servers in the .NET Core ecosystem and other software development environments. When both the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center server and a development server attempt to bind to port 5000 simultaneously, a conflict arises.\nThe Workaround:\nTo address this issue, we can implement a workaround by editing the Windows registry and appending the \u0026ndash;urls parameter to the startup command of the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center service executable. This involves specifying an alternative port, such as 50000, to avoid clashes with the default port used for development servers.\nHere are the step-by-step instructions:\nAccessing the Windows Registry:\nPress Win + R to open the Run dialog. Type regedit and press Enter to open the Registry Editor. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\OneApp.IGCC.WinService. Editing the Registry Entry:\nLocate the ImagePath entry on the right-hand side, which holds the path to the OneApp.IGCC.WinService.exe executable. Append --urls http://127.0.0.1:50000 to the existing path. Ensure that there is a space before the double dash (\u0026ndash;). Example:\n\u0026#34;C:\\Path\\To\\OneApp.IGCC.WinService.exe\u0026#34; --urls http://127.0.0.1:50000 Save the changes.\nRestart the Service:\nRestart the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center service to apply the new configuration. Open the Run dialog again (Win + R), type services.msc, and press Enter. Locate the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center service, right-click, and choose Restart. By following these steps, you have successfully configured the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center server to use an alternative port (50000), avoiding conflicts with the default port used for .NET Core and other development servers.\nConclusion:\nPort conflicts can be a hurdle for developers working on various projects simultaneously. This workaround provides a solution for users encountering conflicts between the Intel(R) Graphics Command Center server and development servers using the default port 5000. By making a simple registry edit, you can ensure a smoother development experience without compromising the functionality of either service.\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-resolve-intel-control-center-port-conflict/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor developers working on .NET Core and other development servers, encountering port conflicts can be a common issue.

This hook can be useful if you want to display dates and times in different languages and formats depending on the user\u0026rsquo;s preferences.\nWhat is a custom React hook? A custom React hook is a function that starts with the word use and may call other hooks. Custom hooks let you reuse stateful logic between components without duplicating code or introducing complex patterns. You can learn more about custom hooks from the official React documentation (1) or this tutorial (2).\nWhat is Intl.DateTimeFormat? Intl.DateTimeFormat is a JavaScript object that enables language-sensitive date and time formatting. It takes a locale (a string that identifies a language and a region) and an options object (that specifies how to format the date and time) as arguments and returns a formatter object that has a format method. You can use this method to convert a Date object into a string that follows the locale and options you provided. You can also use other methods such as formatToParts and formatRange to get more control over the output. You can learn more about Intl.DateTimeFormat from the MDN web docs (3) or this Stack Overflow answer (4).\nHow to create the custom hook? The custom hook we want to create is called useLocaleDateFormat. It takes no arguments and returns an object containing the default locale and three formatting functions: formatDate, formatTime, and formatDateTime. These functions take a Date object as an argument and return a string that represents the date, the time, or the date and time in the default locale.\nHere is the code of the custom hook:\nimport React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; interface UseLocaleDateFormat { defaultLocale: string; formatDate: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; string; formatTime: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; string; formatDateTime: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; string; } /** * Custom hook that provides locale-specific date formatting functions. * @returns An object containing the default locale and formatting functions for date, time, and date-time. */ export function useLocaleDateFormat(): UseLocaleDateFormat { let defaultLocale = (typeof navigator !== \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; navigator.language) || \u0026#39;en-US\u0026#39;; try { // @ts-ignore Intl.DateTimeFormat.supportedLocalesOf([defaultLocale]); } catch (_err) { defaultLocale = \u0026#39;en-US\u0026#39;; } const value = React.useMemo(() =\u0026gt; { return { defaultLocale, formatDate: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; value.toLocaleDateString(defaultLocale), formatTime: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; value.toLocaleTimeString(defaultLocale, { hour: \u0026#39;2-digit\u0026#39;, minute: \u0026#39;2-digit\u0026#39; }), formatDateTime: (value: Date) =\u0026gt; `${value.toLocaleDateString(defaultLocale)} ${value.toLocaleTimeString(defaultLocale, { hour: \u0026#39;2-digit\u0026#39;, minute: \u0026#39;2-digit\u0026#39;, })}`, }; }, [defaultLocale]); return value; } Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the code and explain each part.\nDefine the interface The first thing we do is to define an interface that describes the shape of the object that the hook returns. This is optional, but it helps us to write type-safe code and get better editor support. The interface has four properties: defaultLocale, formatDate, formatTime, and formatDateTime. The first one is a string that represents the default locale, and the rest are functions that take a Date object and return a string.\nGet the default locale The next thing we do is to get the default locale from the navigator.language property, which returns the language of the browser. This property may not be available in some environments, such as server-side rendering, so we use a fallback value of 'en-US' in case it is undefined. We also use a try-catch block to check if the locale is supported by Intl.DateTimeFormat using the supportedLocalesOf method. If the locale is not supported, we also use the fallback value of 'en-US'.\nUse React.useMemo The next thing we do is to use the React.useMemo hook to memoize the value of the object that contains the default locale and the formatting functions. This hook takes a function that returns the value and an array of dependencies as arguments and returns the memoized value. The memoized value is only recomputed when one of the dependencies changes, which in this case is the default locale. This way, we avoid creating a new object and new functions on every render, which can improve performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders of the components that use the hook.\nCreate the formatting functions The last thing we do is to create the formatting functions using the toLocaleDateString, toLocaleTimeString, and template literals. These functions use the default locale and some options to format the date and time according to the user\u0026rsquo;s preferences. For example, the formatDate function uses the toLocaleDateString method, which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the date portion of the Date object. The formatTime function uses the toLocaleTimeString method, which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the time portion of the Date object. The formatDateTime function uses both methods and a template literal to combine the date and time strings into one.\nHow to use the custom hook? To use the custom hook, we simply import it and call it inside a functional component. We can then use the returned object to access the default locale and the formatting functions. For example, we can create a component that displays the current date and time in the default locale:\nimport React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import { useLocaleDateFormat } from \u0026#39;./useLocaleDateFormat\u0026#39;; export function CurrentDateTime() { const { defaultLocale, formatDateTime } = useLocaleDateFormat(); const [now, setNow] = React.useState(new Date()); React.useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { const timer = setInterval(() =\u0026gt; { setNow(new Date()); }, 1000); return () =\u0026gt; { clearInterval(timer); }; }, []); return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The current date and time in {defaultLocale} is:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{formatDateTime(now)}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } This component uses the useLocaleDateFormat hook to get the default locale and the formatDateTime function. It also uses the useState and useEffect hooks to create a state variable for the current date and time and update it every second using a timer. It then renders a paragraph that shows the current date and time in the default locale.\nTests And here are a couple of tests for the useLocaleDateFormat hook.\nimport { renderHook } from \u0026#39;@testing-library/react\u0026#39;; import { useLocaleDateFormat } from \u0026#39;./useLocaleDateFormat\u0026#39;; describe(\u0026#39;useLocaleDateFormat\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { const locale = vitest.spyOn(navigator, \u0026#39;language\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;); it(\u0026#39;should format date, time, and datetime correctly in en-US locale\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { locale.mockReturnValue(\u0026#39;en-US\u0026#39;); const { result } = renderHook(() =\u0026gt; useLocaleDateFormat()); expect(result.current.defaultLocale).toEqual(\u0026#39;en-US\u0026#39;); const date = new Date(2022, 0, 15, 12, 30, 0); const formattedDate = result.current.formatDate(date); expect(formattedDate).toEqual(\u0026#39;1/15/2022\u0026#39;); const formattedTime = result.current.formatTime(date); expect(formattedTime).toEqual(\u0026#39;12:30 PM\u0026#39;); const formattedDateTime = result.current.formatDateTime(date); expect(formattedDateTime).toEqual(\u0026#39;1/15/2022 12:30 PM\u0026#39;); }); it(\u0026#39;should format date, time, and datetime correctly in fi-FI locale\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { locale.mockReturnValue(\u0026#39;fi-FI\u0026#39;); const { result } = renderHook(() =\u0026gt; useLocaleDateFormat()); expect(result.current.defaultLocale).toEqual(\u0026#39;fi-FI\u0026#39;); const date = new Date(2022, 0, 15, 12, 30, 0); const formattedDate = result.current.formatDate(date); expect(formattedDate).toEqual(\u0026#39;15.1.2022\u0026#39;); const formattedTime = result.current.formatTime(date); expect(formattedTime).toEqual(\u0026#39;12.30\u0026#39;); const formattedDateTime = result.current.formatDateTime(date); expect(formattedDateTime).toEqual(\u0026#39;15.1.2022 12.30\u0026#39;); }); }); Conclusion I hope you found this post helpful and learned something new.

One such detail is the proper capitalization of text, especially when dealing with user-generated content or dynamic data. Ensuring that text appears neat and consistent can significantly enhance the user experience. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll introduce you to a handy utility function called capitalizeEachWord that can help you achieve just that.\nWhat is capitalizeEachWord? The capitalizeEachWord function is a TypeScript utility that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string while keeping the rest of the letters in lowercase. This function also allows you to specify a word separator, which can be useful when dealing with text containing multiple words separated by a character or whitespace.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the function code for reference:\nexport const capitalizeEachWord = (input: string, wordSeparator: string) =\u0026gt; input .split(wordSeparator) .map((word) =\u0026gt; word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase()) .join(wordSeparator); How Does It Work? The capitalizeEachWord function works by following these steps:\nSplitting the Input String: It takes the input string and splits it into an array of words using the specified word separator.\nMapping: It then applies a mapping function to each word in the array. In this mapping function, it capitalizes the first letter of each word (using charAt(0).toUpperCase()) and converts the rest of the letters to lowercase (using slice(1).toLowerCase()).\nJoining: Finally, it joins the modified words back together using the same word separator to form a single string with each word capitalized correctly.\nExample Usage Let\u0026rsquo;s illustrate the usage of capitalizeEachWord with some examples:\nconst inputText1 = \u0026#34;hello world\u0026#34;; const inputText2 = \u0026#34;typeScript_is_awesome\u0026#34;; const separator = \u0026#34;_\u0026#34;; const result1 = capitalizeEachWord(inputText1, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;); const result2 = capitalizeEachWord(inputText2, separator); console.log(result1); // Output: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34; console.log(result2); // Output: \u0026#34;TypeScript_Is_Awesome\u0026#34; Benefits of Using capitalizeEachWord\nConsistency: By ensuring that each word starts with a capital letter, you can achieve a consistent and professional look for your text, regardless of the input.\nImproved Readability: Capitalizing each word makes text more readable, especially for titles, headings, or user-generated content.\nCustomization: The function allows you to define the word separator, making it adaptable to various text formatting scenarios.\nEfficiency: capitalizeEachWord streamlines the process of capitalizing words in a string, saving you time and effort in manually formatting text.\nConclusion The capitalizeEachWord utility function is a simple yet powerful tool that can enhance the appearance and readability of your text in web development projects. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re working on a blog, a content management system, or an e-commerce platform, this function can help you achieve consistent and professional text formatting effortlessly. So, the next time you need to capitalize words in a string, remember to give capitalizeEachWord a try, and watch your text come to life!\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-capitalize-each-word-in-typescript/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the world of web development and application design, small details can make a big difference.

Here\u0026rsquo;s an example schema that has a nested array of items:\nconst mongoose = require(\u0026#39;mongoose\u0026#39;); const schema = new mongoose.Schema({ items: [{ name: String, quantity: Number }] }); const Model = mongoose.model(\u0026#39;Model\u0026#39;, schema); ##Updating a specified item in a nested array\nTo update a specified item in a nested array, we can use the MongoDB $ operator along with the $set operator. The $ operator is used to specify which item in the array should be updated.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to update the quantity field of the first item in the items array with the name equal to 'item1':\nModel.updateOne( {\u0026#39;items.name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;item1\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;$set\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;items.$.quantity\u0026#39;: 10}}, (err, result) =\u0026gt; { if (err) { console.error(err); } else { console.log(result); } } ); In this example, the Model.updateOne() method is used to update the first document that matches the query {'items.name': 'item1'}. The $ operator is used in the $set operator to specify that the update should be applied to the first item in the items array that matches the query condition. In this case, the quantity field of the item with name equal to 'item1' will be updated to 10.\nNote that the updateOne() method only updates the first document that matches the query. If there are multiple items in the items array with the name equal to 'item1', only the first one will be updated. To update all items that match the query, you can use the updateMany() method instead.\n","permalink":"https://artosalminen.github.io/posts/how-to-update-specified-item-in-nested-mongo-array-with-mongoose/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over how to update a specified item in a nested array inside a Mongoose document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e##Setting up the environment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s set up the environment by creating a Mongoose schema and model.
